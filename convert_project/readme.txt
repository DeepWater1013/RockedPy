Integration of Python code into a C++ program

Objectives: 
1. Call Python code (e.g., a vehicle trajectory simulator) from a C++ program

2. Define a standard Python class (matching the corresponding C++ simulator class that we already have) so that different Python simulators can be created and integrated using the same Python class template

3. Define a C++ class that can invoke the Python class and return outputs (matching our C++ simulator class)

4. Demonstrate the use of the new Python and C++ class definitions (from a C++ program) on two different open-source Python simulators (need to wrap the two open-source Python simulators using the new Python class and read the parameters needed for the Python simulators from an XML file) under Windows and Linux

5. Convert above Python class (and the underlying simulators) to C++ or compile it into a shared library (e.g., using Nuitka) with our standard C++ simulator class and demonstrate the use of the library under Windows and Linux.
